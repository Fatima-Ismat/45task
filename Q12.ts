// 12. Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person's name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person's name.

let names: string[] = ["Aliza", "Noor", "Ismat", "Fatima"]

let message1: string = "How are you Dear?";

console.log(names[0] + " " + message1)
console.log(names[1] + " " + message1)
console.log(names[2] + " " + message1)
console.log(names[3] + " " + message1)
